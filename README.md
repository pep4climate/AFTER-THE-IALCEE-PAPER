Codes for deriving scour fragility functions for masonry arch bridges.

ABSTRACT: Frequency and intensity of hydrological hazards have increased. Consequently, riverine
bridges are suffering damage due to flooding. Fragility functions are used to estimate such
damage conditioned on hazard intensity. However, flood fragility functions are limited for riverine
bridges, and generally lack for masonry bridges. This paper presents a methodology to derive
flood fragility functions for masonry arch bridges accounting for component failure modes. Demand
and capacity of bridge components are derived from existing analytical expressions, and
account for aleatory uncertainties via Monte Carlo simulations. The methodology is illustrated
using a UK masonry bridge, which collapsed due to winter flood-induced scour. The investigated
bridge is divided into its components (e.g., arches, pier) and a scour fragility function is derived
for the arch, based on a lognormal cumulative distribution fitting to the derived failure probability
data. Future research will develop scour fragility functions for other bridge components.
